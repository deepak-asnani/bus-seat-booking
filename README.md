# Bus Seat Booking App

## Introduction

This repository contains a bus seat booking app (assignment given by Authenticate for an interview process) developed using React. The app allows users to view available seats, book seats, and manage bookings. It provides a user-friendly interface for booking bus seats efficiently.

## Features

- **Seat Availability**: Users can view the availability of seats, booked seats, and seats reserved for females on the bus.
- **Seat Booking**: Users can book available seats by selecting them on the seating chart and then filling a form with their details.
- **Dashboard**: Provides a dashboard to manage booked seats, including editing and deleting bookings.

## Approaches Used

- **React**: The app is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **LocalStorage**: Booking details are stored locally using the browser's localStorage API.
- **Routing**: React Router is used for client-side routing, enabling navigation between different views within the app.
- **Component-based Architecture**: The app follows a component-based architecture, making it modular and easy to maintain.
- **CSS Styling**: Custom CSS styles are applied to enhance the visual appeal and usability of the app.

## Limitations

- **Single User**: The app currently supports booking seats for a single user at a time. Multi-user support could be implemented for future versions.

- **Error Handling**: Error handling and validation could be improved to provide better feedback to users in case of errors or invalid inputs.

## Areas for Improvement

- **Responsiveness**: Right now it handles the responsiveness till tab sizes, it can be improved for mobile size screens.
